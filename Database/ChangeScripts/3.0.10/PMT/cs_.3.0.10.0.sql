/******************************************************************
Change Script 3.0.10.0

This change script was written specifically for pmt9, a BMGF, TanAIM
& AGRA shared instance. This is part of a series of change scripts 
that together will remove project from the PMT data model and make
several core data model updates.

1. move project data into activity & related entities
2. reorder columns and update all core columns with underscore
3. recreate/create indexes on all appropriate fields (id, foreign keys, 
   and common fields)
4. Remove records that will violate constrants applied in cs.3.0.10.1
5. Update/remove taxonomies to adhere to updates applied in cs.3.0.10.3
