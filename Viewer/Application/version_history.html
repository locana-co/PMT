                            <li>Added geographic filter to the Map page. The geographic filter provides a filter menu of
                                one or more boundary levels. Selecting a boundary feature will limit the data on the map

                            <li>Expanded the data model so that locations are mapping level aware. This means that any given
                                location in the database understands what administrative level it is map to and how it is
                                related to any boundary loaded with in the system. Locaiton mapped at the country level will
                                not be shown or aggregated below the admin level zero of any boundary. </li>
                            <li>Added configurable "in-use" option to all taxonomy filters (Summmary, Map &amp; Activity
                                pages). When enabled, only classifications in-use by the selected data groups will be shown
                                in the filter options. The filter options are updated when the data group selections are
                                updated.

                                the "Other" from legend when "Other" counts were not present.</li>

                            <li>Added functionality to the Summary page to allow users to view summarized data by multiple
